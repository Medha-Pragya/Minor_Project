## Game Overview
This is a fork of original game by [yakudoo](https://github.com/yakudoo) [here](https://github.com/yakudoo/TheAviator.git). It was supposed to be a simple weekend project cause I had nothing better to do.

## How to Play
To play the game directly, go to [demo site](https://akay25.github.io/TheAviator/). 
Mouse movements are used to control the airplane to dodge red balls and collect the blue fuel. 

As the level bar increases, the speed of the plane increases until you're in next level.
